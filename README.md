# Newsletter-Signup

## JavaScript Used

    NodeJS (Server-Side)
    ExpressJS (Node Framework)
    NPM Modules
        bodyParser
        request

## Project Description
This server-side project uses Mailchimp's API to create a working, real-world newsletter sign-up form application. This JavaScript project form is actually integrated with this site's newsletter sign-up campaign, so if you haven't already done so, sign up to my Mailchimp Newsletter Heroku application. üòÅ 

## Time to Code
This took about 3 hours, start to finish, including watching part of Angela's (@angelabauer) solution and then going back to finish my own solution.

## Lines of Code
This project took 70 lines of code for the JavaScript application itself (app.js), but because it uses three different routes in the express web framework, it's a little more than 200 lines total.
